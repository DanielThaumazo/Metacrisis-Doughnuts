# Metacrisis-Informed Doughnut Economics for Bioregional Regeneration

## Overview

This project leverages the framework of Doughnut Economics to visually represent the facets of the Metacrisis in the context of bioregional regeneration. The goal is to provide an interactive, data-driven dashboard that identifies and contextualizes key challenges and opportunities within specific bioregions, using the Fraser Lowland as a starting point. 

The Metacrisis framework is segmented into eight critical facets:
1. Extinction Edge → Resilient Renaissance
2. Fragile Web → Interwoven Harmony
3. Truth Tornado → Shared Light
4. Soul Split → Cultural Wholeness
5. Earth Erosion → Regenerative Abundance
6. Power Pyramid → Equitable Commons
7. Tech Tsunami → Tech Symphony
8. Leadership Lapse → Adaptive Stewardship

Each facet is visualized as a doughnut chart, consisting of two concentric rings:
- **Inner Ring:** Represents initiatives, efforts, and systems aimed at mitigating the risks and challenges associated with each facet.
- **Outer Ring:** Represents the vulnerabilities, risks, and systemic breakdowns specific to the facet.

### Purpose and Intent
The primary objective of this project is to contextualize the Metacrisis within bioregional frameworks, allowing for targeted interventions that align with local needs and capacities. This visualization system is designed to:
- Highlight systemic vulnerabilities in bioregions
- Showcase emergent, community-led initiatives
- Support coordination and resource allocation for regenerative efforts
- Facilitate informed decision-making based on dynamic, real-time data

### Data Structure
Each facet is structured with the following components:
- **Info Object:** Contains facet name, description, opposite facet, and images.
- **Inner Ring Data:** Includes initiatives, projects, or systems that are actively working to address specific challenges in the bioregion.
- **Outer Ring Data:** Contains identified risks, systemic breakdowns, and areas of concern within the bioregion.

### How to Use
- Click on segments of the inner ring to explore initiatives and efforts aimed at resilience and regeneration.
- Click on segments of the outer ring to view vulnerabilities, risks, and areas of concern.
- Use the information panel to access detailed descriptions, related initiatives, and potential collaborators.

### Current Implementation
- Eight doughnut charts representing the eight Metacrisis facets
- Interactive data points with hover and click functionality
- Dynamic information panel that updates based on selected segments
- CSS and JavaScript structured for modular expansion

### Next Steps
- Integrate real-time data streams for each facet to reflect ongoing initiatives and emerging risks
- Expand bioregional coverage beyond the Fraser Lowland
- Incorporate storytelling elements to contextualize data points with personal narratives and case studies
- Develop a backend system for data entry and management
- Implement export and sharing functionality for reports and visualizations
