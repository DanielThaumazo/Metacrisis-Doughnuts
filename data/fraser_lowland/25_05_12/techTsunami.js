	  facetDescription: "Advances in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and digital surveillance, pose both opportunities and risks. The rapid pace of technological change outstrips the capacity of social, legal, and ethical systems to keep up, leading to unintended consequences and new forms of control and exploitation.",

	  oppositeImg: "./img/07_TechSymphony.png",
	  oppositeDescription: "A balanced and humane integration of technology into society, where AI, biotechnology, and digital innovations are designed and governed for the benefit of all. Technology enhances human potential while being guided by ethical principles, safeguarding privacy, and amplifying human agency. Innovations in health, education, and the environment serve the common good, promoting wellbeing, creativity, and autonomy."
