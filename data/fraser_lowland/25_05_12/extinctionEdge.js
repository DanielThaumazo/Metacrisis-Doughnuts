    text: "Efforts to establish bioregional governance in the Fraser Lowland are gaining momentum, particularly through collaborations between municipalities and First Nations. Initiatives like the Fraser Basin Council aim to harmonize land-use planning across jurisdictions, addressing challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable development. However, jurisdictional fragmentation remains a significant hurdle, impeding coherent responses to existential risks. Strengthening these partnerships and developing shared long-term visions are crucial for effective bioregional governance."
