	  facetDescription: "This facet involves the fragmentation of cultural narratives and identities, leading to a loss of meaning, purpose, and connection among individuals and communities. The increase in mental health issues, social isolation, and the decline of community bonds are in part symptomatic of this broader cultural and psychological unraveling.",

	  oppositeDescription: "A flourishing of diverse, inclusive cultural narratives that inspire purpose, meaning, and connection across individuals and communities. Reunited with a sense of belonging and shared values, people form strong bonds of community, while embracing both global perspectives and local traditions. A deep sense of psychological well-being and cultural continuity fosters resilience in the face of personal and collective challenges."
