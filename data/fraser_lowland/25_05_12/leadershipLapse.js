	  facetDescription: "Many of the world's governance systems are not equipped to handle the complexity of the metacrisis. These systems often operate in silos, are slow to adapt, and are prone to corruption, inefficiency, and short-term thinking. This governance deficit makes it difficult to coordinate global responses to interconnected crises.",

	  oppositeDescription: "Dynamic, agile leadership systems rooted in wisdom, foresight, and long-term thinking guide global and local responses to challenges. Governance is transparent, responsive, and adaptive, with diverse leadership structures that prioritize collaboration and shared responsibility. Leaders act as stewards of complexity, working across silos and engaging citizens in a co-creative process to shape a thriving, interconnected world."
