As these systems become more interconnected, they also become more susceptible to cascading failures, where a disruption in one area can trigger a chain reaction of crises across multiple domains.",

	  oppositeDescription: "A resilient global network of systems—economic, political, environmental, and technological—where interdependencies foster cooperation, mutual support, and adaptability. This harmonious interconnection creates a world where local disruptions are mitigated, and cascading failures are prevented by strong, decentralized solutions and proactive, agile governance."
