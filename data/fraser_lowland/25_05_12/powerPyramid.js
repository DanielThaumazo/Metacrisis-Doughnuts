	  facetDescription: "Growing inequality, both within and between countries, is another critical element of the metacrisis. The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few, coupled with the disenfranchisement of large populations, fuels social unrest, destabilizes political systems, and hinders collective action to address global challenges.",

	  oppositeDescription: "A just and equitable global system where power and resources are distributed in a way that fosters opportunity, fairness, and dignity for all. Communities practice economic, social, and political inclusivity, and policies are designed to diminish inequalities while empowering disenfranchised populations. Cooperative governance and shared wealth systems ensure that all have a voice and stake in our collective future."
